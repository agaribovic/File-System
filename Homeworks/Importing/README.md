Pick any library that come with Python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/) that we haven't covered in the course already.

Learn how to use the library extensively, then prepare a code sample that showcases what you've learned. This can take any form you wish. You could create an application with the library, or just show examples of how to use its methods.
