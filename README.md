###Note-taking

When a user starts it up, it prompts them for a filename.

If they enter a file name that doesn't exist, it prompts them to enter the text they want to write to the file. After they enter the text, it saves the file and exits.

If they enter a file name that already exists, it asks the user if they want to:

A) Read the file

B) Delete the file and start over

C) Append the file

D) Replace a single line

  - If the user wants to replace a single line in the file, they will then need to be prompted for 2 bits of information:

      1) The line number they want to update.

      2) The text that should replace that line.
