Have you ever played "Connect 4"? It's a popular kid's game by the Hasbro company. In this project, your task is create a Connect 4 game in Python. Before you get started, please watch this video on the rules of Connect 4:

Once you've got the rules down, your assignment should be fairly straightforward. You'll want to draw the board, and allow two players to take turns placing their pieces on the board (but as you learned above, they can only do so by choosing a column, not a row). The first player to get 4 across or diagonal should win!

Normally the pieces would be red and black, but you can use X and O instead.
